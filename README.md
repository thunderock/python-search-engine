### What is this repository for? ###
* FUN

### Assumptions in problem statement
* score calculations

1. if document is "Ford, Car, Review, Ford" and query is "Ford Car Ford" relevance score becomes
(8 * 8 + 7 * 7 + 5 * 8 + 8 * 6 + 5 * 6) = 231, notice Ford occurs two times in document.

2. there is a typo in results of Q5: p5 should be there.


### Steps to setup

1. setup_script.sh sets up virtual env and runs main.py
program reads from input.txt
2. checked setup_script in my ubuntu desktop, but depending 
on python 3 version you might have to add some packages in requirements.txt
apart from what is currently added.
3. script install venv in current directory.
